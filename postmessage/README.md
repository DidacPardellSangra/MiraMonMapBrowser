# PostMessage demo

The MiraMon Map Browser can be controlled from an external JavaScript application using the postmessage function.

The objective is that all functionalities available for the storymap HTML format will also be available as postmessage instructions.

Please note that the current code example is using a fix URL. Please modify the URL to communicate to other map browsers.
